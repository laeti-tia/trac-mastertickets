Notes
=====
Adds basic ticket dependencies for Trac.

What is it?
-----------
This plugin adds "blocks" and "blocked by" fields to each ticket, enabling you
to express dependencies between tickets. It also provides a graphviz-based
dependency-graph feature for those tickets having dependencies specified,
allowing you to visually understand the dependency tree. The dependency graph
is viewable by clicking 'depgraph' in the context (in the upper right corner)
menu when viewing a ticket that blocks or is blocked by another ticket.

What is it not?
---------------
* It does not provide ticket-hiding for sub-tasks of a top-level ticket.  

  * There is no orthogonal parent/child relationship possible

  * You cannot view the descriptions of tickets depending on the current
    ticket

  * In fact, there are no explicit features that can assist you with sub-task
    management

  * Although it would be cool.

* It does not allow you to create a dependent ticket from the current ticket

* It does not include reporting features to show how tasks are interrelated
  (other than the dependency graph already described above).

Configuration
=============
To use this plugin you must configure two custom fields named ``blocking``
and ``blocked_by``.

All other configuration options go in the ``[mastertickets]`` section.

``dot_path`` : *optional, default: dot*
    Path to the dot executable. This is only used for the dependency graph.

``use_gs`` : *optional, default: False*
    If enabled, use ghostscript to produce a nicer dependency graph.

``gs_path`` : *optional, default: gs*
    Path to the ghostscript executable.

To enable the plugin::

    [components]
    mastertickets.* = enabled
    
    [ticket-custom]
    blocking = text
    blocking.label = Blocking
    blockedby = text
    blockedby.label = Blocked By

Custom fields
-------------
While the two field names must be ``blocking`` and ``blocked_by``, you are
free to use any text for the field labels.

Example
=======

To use a locally-built graphviz::

    [mastertickets]
    dot_path = /usr/local/bin/dot
    
    [components]
    mastertickets.* = enabled
    
    [ticket-custom]
    blocking = text
    blocking.label = Blocking
    blockedby = text
    blockedby.label = Blocked By
